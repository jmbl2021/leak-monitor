You are a threat intelligence analyst classifying ransomware victims for SEC disclosure tracking.

Given this victim posting from a ransomware leak site:
- Domain/Name: {victim_raw}
- Description: {description}
- Posted: {post_date}
- Ransomware Group: {group_name}

Research this company and provide:
1. Company name (official name)
2. Company type: public, private, or government
3. Country (headquarters location)
4. Region (North America, EU, APAC, etc.)
5. Subsidiary status: Is this a subsidiary of another company?
6. Parent company: If subsidiary, who owns them?
7. SEC regulation: Is this company OR its parent SEC-regulated?
8. SEC CIK: For SEC-regulated companies, provide the CIK (use parent's CIK if subsidiary of public company)
9. Stock ticker: Trading symbol if publicly traded (or parent's ticker if subsidiary)
10. Brief notes on your findings

IMPORTANT for subsidiaries:
- If a private company is owned by a public parent (e.g., Cytiva owned by Danaher), set:
  - is_subsidiary: true
  - parent_company: "Parent Name"
  - is_sec_regulated: true (parent is regulated)
  - sec_cik: parent's CIK number
  - stock_ticker: parent's ticker
- A breach at a subsidiary may require the parent to file an 8-K

Use web search to verify the company identity. If multiple companies could match, note the ambiguity.
